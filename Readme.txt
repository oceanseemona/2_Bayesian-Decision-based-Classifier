Assignment-2 : Bayesian Decision-based Classifier

OBJECTIVE:

Question_1: To generate 500 2-dimensional data points that are distributed according to the Gaussian distribution using mean and covariance.

Question_2: To generate two data sets X1 and X2 consisting of 1000 and 5000 points respectively. Taking X1 as the training set, we have to classify the points in X2 using the squared Euclidean distance-based classifier.

Question_3: To generate a set X1 (training) & X2 (testing) that consists of N1 = 50 & N2=10000 5-dimensional data vectors respectively that stem from two equiprobable classes, ω1 and ω2.


INSTALL:

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed :-

>NumPy
command prompt: pip install numpy

>Pandas
command prompt: pip install pandas

>Sklearn
command prompt: pip install sklearn

>Matplotlib
command prompt: pip install matplotlib

>Jupyter Notebook
command prompt: pip install jupyter

If Python is not installed yet, Anaconda distribution of Python can also be used, which already has the above packages.

OUTPUT:

Question_1: The generated numbers to visualize the distributions has been plotted.
Question_2: Computed the classification error.
Question_3: Computed the error probability.
